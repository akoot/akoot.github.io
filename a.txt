# Projects
UltraVanilla
A community-centered semi-vanilla Minecraft server founded in 2019 with custom plugins. Ownership was transferred in early 2022 and it's still ongoing.

Untitled Server
Another community-centered semi-vanilla Minecraft server with custom plugins. This time, I want to give it more of my personal touch. This project is in closed beta and not available for the masses just yet! Currently my highest priority project.

cloud.akoot.me
Personal cloud storage front-end for my friends and I. This may turn into something more ambitious, revolutionary, even.

AKUI
User interface design to be used on future projects. Dark and light edition.

AkootCoin
Faux cryptocurrency for fun! These are technically IOUs but they are fun to use! New design in the works...

# Contact
Email
The best way to contact me as a complete stranger is email! I will check it and that's a promise.

Hate Mail
If you hate me straight up, have something against me, wish me dead, want to say nasty things to me directly, you can always send me some hate mail!

Discord
If you are a zoomer you probably already have Discord and use it regularly. My current tag is Akoot_#9000, you can add me or just join my public server.
